Backup your packages, apps, and configurations directly to git in the form of profiles. Set up any new (virtual) machine using a profile in one line. Share profiles between multiple machines. Configure auto update, clean-up, and back-up. Works for all linux flavors, Mac OS, and Windows.

All installation and backup scripts require you to pass a profile name as their first argument. If you provide no profile name to a script, they'll use the default `personal` profile.

Example use:
```sh
# Set up your new machine quickly using a profile
install.sh <profile-name>
# Assume you're customising your installation here by installing new packages, editing shell configuration, etc
backup.sh <profile-name>
# Now if you're working on your own fork, you can commit this profile and later use it to set up new machines or make reinstallations way easier!
```

## Getting Started

To simplify instructions, the paths provided in this README are for macOS scripts. However, these all have their counterparts for other OSs. You just need to replace the `macos` part with `linux` or `windows`, or `unix` part with `windows`. Sometimes additional minor changes to the path are required as well but it should all be clear and intuitive.

### Creating a Profile

First, fork this repository and clone it on your machine. Then:

```sh
<project-dir>/scripts/unix/backup.sh <profile-name>
```

This will back-up your packages, apps, and configurations to the profile you've given - `personal` if left blank. Creating the profile as necessary if it doesn't exist.

### Installing a Profile

The following steps assume that you are doing the setup on a freshly formatted computer. Therefore you don't even have your SSH keys or anything set up.

Open the Terminal app and enter the commands below.

```sh
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
# It's recommended to use your own fork so you can commit your profile changes later on.
git clone https://github.com/isair/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

If your setup does not come with `git`, download this project from its GitHub page instead. Later on, the profile you install will most likely have `git`.

Before typing the following line, make sure you check the various profiles under the `profiles` directory and pick one that suits your needs.

```sh
./scripts/macos/install.sh <profile-name>
```

## Automating Backup, Cleanup & Updates

One way to automate backup and cleanup is to add cron jobs for these scripts.

```sh
crontab -e
```

Append the following line, changing the path as necessary.
```sh
0 15 * * * ~/projects/dotfiles/scripts/unix/backup.sh <profile-name>
```

This will update your package list but you'll still need to commit and push yourself, or write a script for it.

```sh
sudo crontab -e
```

Append the following line, changing the path again as needed.
```sh
00 8 * * * /home/owner/projects/dotfiles/scripts/unix/update.sh
00 9 * * * /home/owner/projects/dotfiles/scripts/unix/cleanup.sh
```

Your computer will now update everything and clean-up disk space in the morning. At 15:00, it will do backups.

## Sharing Profiles Between Machines

All dot files are symlinked to your project clone directory. The update script is also responsible for `git pull`ing any changes made to the repo. Therefore, if you have set up automatic updates as mentioned in the previous section, all you need to do is `git push` your changes! Any machine installed using the same profile will automatically get them when their update script runs again.
